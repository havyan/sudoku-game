    "p1": "Genius Sudoku has the patent certification of nine Sudoku game.  Players can enter the game after building the table in the hall. Players can participate in the waiting game table, or also can be used as a banker to build a table waiting for others to participate in the game. If as bankers, players should choose topic level, time for each step, time for each round, number of people for each round, way to start, and waiting time. According to the player’s preference and level, choose the right option and then click the enter button to build table.",
    "p2": "Chat functionality of Genius Sudoku will open after the game start, and players can fully exchange ideas and experiences by using chat function. During the game, the player’s order is determined by seating, so banker needs to answer firstly. When the very high difficulty of a nine Sudoku appeared on the banker's eyes, banker should first looks for simple and obvious Numbers from the standard Sudoku. Other players have time to see, and also can use the draft in the upper left corner to mark.",
    "p3": "Genius Sudoku game has a timer, when players submit the numbers, the moon is yellow, the other time is white, the mouse on top of head can see player statistics.",
    "p4": "Genius Sudoku games have submitted/draft mode and ordinary/candidate mode. In submitted/draft mode, up to 4 numbers or letters can be mark in the blanks in the draft, your answer should switch to submit mode, click on the grid in the input box to choose Numbers. In ordinary/candidate mode, the candidate mode can show the candidate numbers (1-4) in all blank grids, and answering questions need to switch to ordinary mode. Candidate mode only can be used in candidate props or global candidate card props.",
    "p5": "Nine Sudoku board is bigger, so we set with zoom. Props can be drag to anywhere that the players like or convenient place. When the response time is almost finish and players are failed to get the right answer, the Pass button is suitable for you to give up the answer, but it will penalized points more than a game timeout. Players can see instant rankings and accumulative points in real-time. The overtime answering will be penalized. In submitting mode, when the player intends to submit the number, input box will pop up by clicking on the blank grid. The numbers inside of the box are the candidate of the grid number, input box can be dragged, and click a number to submit. If the number is right, the player can get the marks, otherwise, marks will be deducted for wrong answers. Scoring is based on the length of time spent, the shorter the time, the more points scored. And different time intervals are distinguished by different colors of timer. In Genius Sudoku game, the existing numbers are black, and all players submitted numbers are green.",
    "p6": "In such a difficult nine Sudoku game, the player certainly needs some props, so we developed 6 types of new props. They are magnifying glass, delay card, candidate card respectively, global candidate card, impunity card, and smart glasses. Under the submitted mode, using a magnifying glass prop, the player can fill in the correct Numbers directly. When the player answering question in using time delay props, the timer will stop for a period of time, thus the player get some more time to think. Using candidate card, candidate numbers of all blank grids for the current round will be showed immediately. Indeed, it can help players to better understand the whole situation of candidate numbers, therefore the player may find the only candidate number more easily .If you use global candidate card, can be shown all the candidate number of blank grids on the board immediately and continues to benefit the player until the end of the game. If you use the impunity card, you can make up deducted scores for last round, that is to say, this prop is the key for players who want race to first in the game. In not answer mode, when other players to answer, using smart glasses props help players to view the candidate number in any blank grids, but cannot be submitted. All these props are greatly increase the possibility of winning for players. Of course, as a new and high difficulty game, we will give some free props for registered players, which are 3 magnifying glasses, 3 delay cards, 3 candidate cards, 1 global candidate card, 3 impunity cards, and 3 smart glasses. You can top up to buy props after finishing your free props. As well as price is not expensive, so it worth to help players to speed up the upgrade of nine Sudoku.",
